## Working Logs

- I'm beginner so there will be nothing at all for organizing my folder, it is gonna be bad for some experienced out there but yeah! I tried and Imma back with some standards later üòû

- `connect-to-mongodb-sample` is my practice using `mongodb` module to connect with a local or an Atlas MongoDB

- After that I have my mindset of how it works and put it in `mongoose`

- `mongoose` got some tricky things here too, it is hard the first time to really write it correctly in `models/user.js`, why? read my comments to make it clear üòÖ
